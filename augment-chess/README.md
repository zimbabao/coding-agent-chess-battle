## Installation

No external dependencies required - uses only Python standard library.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd chess
```

## Usage

### UCI Mode (Default)

Run the engine in UCI mode to connect with chess GUIs like Arena, ChessBase, or Lichess:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Interactive Mode

Test the engine interactively with full Chess960 support:

```bash
python main.py --interactive
```

Commands in interactive mode:
- `show` - Display current board position
- `move <uci>` - Make a move (e.g., `move e2e4`)
- `undo` - Undo the last move
- `legal` - Show all legal moves
- `eval` - Evaluate current position
- `best [depth]` - Find best move (optional search depth)
- `perft <depth>` - Run performance test
- `reset` - Reset to starting position
- `chess960 <id>` - Set up Chess960 position (0-959)
- `random960` - Set up random Chess960 position
- `standard` - Switch to standard chess
- `quit` - Exit

### Web Interface

Launch the web interface with Chess960 support:

```bash
# Standard chess web interface
python main.py --web

# Chess960 web interface with specific position
python main.py --web --chess960 --position 356

# Chess960 web interface with random position
python main.py --web --chess960
```

The web interface provides:
- Visual chess board with drag-and-drop moves
- Chess960 position selection and random generation
- Engine analysis and best move suggestions
- Game state information and move history

### Testing

Run the built-in tests:

```bash
# Standard chess tests
python main.py --test

# Comprehensive Chess960 tests
python main.py --test-chess960

# Chess960 demonstration
python demo_chess960.py
```

### Performance Testing

Run perft (performance test) to verify move generation correctness:

```bash
python main.py --perft 5

# Chess960 perft test
python main.py --perft 4 --chess960 --position 356
```

## Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) Features

### What is Chess960?

Chess960, also known as Fischer Random Chess, is a variant of chess where the starting position of pieces on the back rank is randomized. There are 960 possible starting positions, all following specific rules:

1. **Bishops** must be placed on opposite-colored squares
2. **King** must be placed between the two rooks
3. **Pawns** remain in their standard positions
4. **Castling** rules are adapted for arbitrary king/rook positions

### Chess960 Implementation

This engine provides complete Chess960 support with:

#### Position Generation
- **All 960 positions** correctly generated using the standard Chess960 algorithm
- **Position ID system** (0-959) for reproducible games
- **Validation** ensures all positions meet Chess960 constraints
- **Performance optimized** generation (<1ms per position)

#### Chess960 Castling
- **Flexible castling** from any king/rook starting positions
- **Standard target squares** (king to c1/g1, rook to d1/f1)
- **Proper validation** of castling through/into/out of check
- **Original position tracking** for castling rights

#### Usage Examples

```python
# Create Chess960 engine with specific position
engine = ChessEngine(chess960=True, position_id=518)

# Create Chess960 engine with random position
engine = ChessEngine(chess960=True)

# Set up specific Chess960 position
engine.setup_chess960_position(356)

# Generate random Chess960 position
position_id = engine.generate_random_chess960_position()

# Check if engine is in Chess960 mode
if engine.is_chess960():
    print(f"Chess960 Position ID: {engine.get_chess960_position_id()}")
```

#### Command Line Examples

```bash
# Start UCI engine in Chess960 mode
python main.py --chess960 --position 356

# Interactive Chess960 session
python main.py --interactive
chess> chess960 518
chess> random960

# Web interface with Chess960
python main.py --web --chess960 --position 100

# Performance test with Chess960
python main.py --perft 5 --chess960 --position 0
```

### Chess960 Position Examples

- **Position 0**: `BBQNNRKR` - First Chess960 position
- **Position 518**: `RNBQKBNR` - Standard chess equivalent
- **Position 959**: `RKRNNQBB` - Last Chess960 position

### Chess960 Validation

The engine validates all Chess960 positions to ensure:
- Exactly 2 bishops on opposite-colored squares
- Exactly 1 king between 2 rooks
- All 960 positions are unique and valid
- Proper piece placement and constraints

## UCI Commands Supported

- `uci` - Initialize UCI mode
- `isready` - Engine ready check
- `ucinewgame` - Start new game
- `position [startpos|fen] [moves ...]` - Set position
- `go [depth N] [movetime MS] [wtime MS] [btime MS] [winc MS] [binc MS]` - Search for best move
- `stop` - Stop search
- `quit` - Exit engine

## Development

### Adding Features

The engine is designed to be easily extensible:

- Add new evaluation features in `evaluation.py`
- Implement advanced search techniques in `search.py`
- Add opening book support
- Implement endgame tablebases
- Add neural network evaluation

### Testing

The engine includes several test modes:

1. **Unit tests** - Basic functionality tests
2. **Perft tests** - Move generation verification
3. **Interactive mode** - Manual testing and analysis

### Performance

Current performance on a modern CPU:
- ~50,000 nodes/second in search
- Perft(6) in ~10 seconds
- Typical search depth 6-8 plies in tournament time controls

## Known Limitations

- No opening book
- No endgame tablebases
- Basic time management
- No parallel search
- Simple evaluation function
- No learning capabilities

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Areas for improvement:

- Advanced search techniques (null move, late move reductions)
- Better evaluation (pawn structure, piece coordination)
- Opening book integration
- Endgame tablebase support
- Performance optimizations
- UCI option handling
